<h2>Project objective</h2>
<p>There is often a need to urgently go to the hospital (polyclinic), but they do not accept without a medical card, and even if the doctor accepts the patient, he will write out instructions for treatment and medications on an ordinary piece of paper, which in turn is easy to lose. Or consider the case of honey loss. Cards, the entire medical history will be lost without the possibility of recovery, and you have to fill out and buy a new one (there have been cases when a person accumulated 10 cards). Also, with the next trip to the doctor, he had a different work schedule, and had to postpone the trip for days, weeks, or even abandon it altogether. That's why we decided to develop a website called "MedCard".
<br>Our website will allow: <br>
Patients to see their med. A map from anywhere in the world, to see the author of the record, prescribed medications, the last trip to the doctor by the date of the last record, to see a brief biography of the doctor and his schedule of work "reception time", electronic certificates for study / work and various courses / sections, as well as the readability of the printed text is much superior to human handwriting.
The doctor will be able to quickly and conveniently find information about the patient, prescribe everything necessary for him and view the previously left records of other doctors. See an assessment of the severity of a particular record, and take into account allergies and other important things when prescribing medications and treatment methods.</p>

4.Patient creates themselves (registers).  <br>
5.To start, create an admin. You need to navigate to the following path: MCard40.Web - Areas - Identity - Pages - Account - Register.cshtml.cs   <br>
6.Uncomment line 139.  <br>
7.Comment out lines 141 to 148.  <br>
8.Then run the project.  <br>
9.Go to the registration page.  <br>
10.Register the admin.  <br>
11.You are now logged in as the admin.  <br>
12.You need to close the tab (red cross).  <br>
